					<p>It happens to everyone sooner or later: Constipation. Maybe you don’t poop for days at a time,
						but you used to go every day. Or when you do go, your stool is hard, dry and small, which can
						cause strain and is perhaps painful. Constipation can take several forms and may come and go,
						but it often involves both uncomfortable stool changes and less frequent bowel movements.</p>

					<p>Shoulder impingement is an overuse injury in the rotator cuff -- the muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint. It is caused by “repetitive overhead activities while the shoulder joint is in a forward rotated position,” said Jessica Moyer, owner of Viva Stretch in Jacksonville, Fla., and a sport rehabilitation specialist for nearly 20 years.</p>
